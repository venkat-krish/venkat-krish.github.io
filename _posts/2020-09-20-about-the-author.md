Hi! I'm Venkat. Iâ€™m a microbiologist major turned programmer. Ever since I first learned how to program while taking a scientific computing for bioinformatics course, I have pursued programming as a passion, and as a career. Check out [my portfolio repository](https://www.github.com/venkat-krish/) for more information on my other projects.
