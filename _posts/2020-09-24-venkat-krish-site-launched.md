It is always good to have a personal website to share about ourself and our thoughts to others. [Github.io](https://github.io/) website is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), which is a nice feature as it supports markdown script to create content. 

## Blog Post

The blog posts can be made in **Markdown** file *.md* and uploaded in a specific layout to get rendered in the website.
